      <h2>Apr 19, 2014</h2>
      It seems there&rsquo;s a bug when upgrading Lubuntu to version 14.04 that causes the network manager applet to disappear from the system tray. I&rsquo;ve experienced the problem on two separate installations so I&rsquo;m going to guess this is a widespread problem. The fix is easy. Just open a terminal session and run this command: echo &quot;nm-applet&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart All the command does is add nm-applet to your LXDE autostart file. If you logout and log back in, the network manager applet should be running.

      <h2>Mar 12, 2014</h2>
      Today I became the proud owner of alexj.sexy following in the footsteps of people like Myke Hurley of myke.sexy. This is possibly the best $25 I&rsquo;ve ever spent. Joking aside, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice how stupid some of the new TLDs are. A sliver do allow for some creative and memorable domains but for the most part they&rsquo;re pretty useless. Take, for example, the .guru TLD. How many times in the past year have you referred to someone as a guru?

      <h2>Feb 3, 2014</h2>
      Out of curiosity I spent my Sunday afternoon moving this blog from Amazon S3 to a DigitalOcean VPS (spoiler, that&rsquo;s a referral link). I didn&rsquo;t have a solid reason to do this&mdash;it&rsquo;s both more expensive and more effort&mdash;aside from to learn. I&rsquo;ve never set up a web server from scratch before let alone owned a VPS. I kind of felt I needed one so I could earn some geek cred. I&rsquo;m running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on the VPS since Ubuntu&rsquo;s the Linux distribution I have the most experience with[^1].

      Just under a month ago, I [wrote about][project-changes] which projects I&rsquo;d be focusing my time on in the coming year. The main takeaway from the post was that [Geography AS Notes][gas-project-page] was going to get some love. Well, here&rsquo;s my first packet of love[^1], a redesign. [project-changes]: {{ site.baseurl }}/12/project-updates/ [gas-project-page]: {{ site.baseurl }}/projects/geographyas/ It&rsquo;s been nearly two years since I last refreshed Geography AS Notes&rsquo; design and in that time its grown boring and stale.

      This is a boring updated on the status of several of my projects. If you don&rsquo;t care about them then just give this post a miss. There&rsquo;ll be a new post in a couple of months which may be more interesting. My situation&rsquo;s changed a lot in the past couple of months. I&rsquo;m now at university, living away from my parents, studying what I want to study with some great people.

      <h2>Aug 10, 2013</h2>
      The newest entry in the Tomb Raider franchise is a much needed reboot of an ageing series. Published by Square Enix &amp; developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game is a major improvement over past titles in the series with the developers focusing a significant amount of their resources on creating an engaging and enjoyable solo experience. The story of the new Tomb Raider is the real meat of the game. It focuses on the early days of Lara Croft as she is thrown between a rock and a hard place and starts to develop her survival skills.

      <h2>Mar 31, 2013</h2>
      This is a very small update for SymSteam that fixes two bugs you probably didn&rsquo;t even know existed. The first, a simple spelling mistake in an error message. The second, a cock-up with pointers that meant that if an error occurred while deleting an old symbolic link an empty error message would be displayed. Not particularly helpful. Code wise, SymSteam should be easier to translate into other languages because I&rsquo;ve changed all the user interface strings so that they&rsquo;re created using NSLocalizedString() and are stored in a strings file.

      Since releasing the first version of the script I use to deploy this blog to S3, I&rsquo;ve iterated on the script a little bit and made a few changes. Most of the changes in version 2 of the script are syntax changes to the script itself that make it a little bit easier to read[^1] however there are a couple of functionality changes. The biggest change is the introduction of command line flags.

      <h2>Jan 17, 2013</h2>
      If you’re the type of person who likes to read the footers of websites (who doesn’t?) you’ll have seen that this website is &ldquo;powered” by Jekyll. In case you haven’t heard, Jekyll is a static site generator that is especially useful for generating static blogs. That is, you run the Jekyll program on a computer, point it at a “source” directory for your website and let it generate a load of HTML files that you can upload to practically any web server that serves files.

      <h2>Dec 31, 2012</h2>
      It may have taken nearly 9 months but beta 2 of SymSteam is finally available for download. This is a huge update for SymSteam that completely changes how it works and fixes many bugs as a result. SymSteam no longer manages drives based on their names, rather, it relies on the UUID of a drive to determine if the drive is the Steam drive. This makes SymSteam more reliable in situations where you have drives with the same name but it does introduce a new requirement.

      <h2>Dec 31, 2012</h2>
      After building a new computer recently I went ahead and installed Ubuntu 12.10 on it alongside Windows. Since the computer doesn&rsquo;t have a wireless card and isn&rsquo;t anywhere near a router, I bought a cheap Wireless USB adapter so that I could connect to my wireless network. I actually bought the adapter several years ago and used it on a computer running Ubuntu 10.04 that was in a similar situation. The adapter I bought was a Belkin F5D8053, the v6 revision.

      It would seem that pretty much the only thing I use this blog for is announcements. Guess what&rsquo;s in this post, some more announcements, specifically regarding some new projects that I&rsquo;ve started in the past month (and a bit). Now that I&rsquo;ve got a lot more free time on my hands, I&rsquo;ve managed to start two new Cocoa projects for the Mac, one of which I&rsquo;ve been intending to do for several months.

      Yesterday (June 11th) marked the first day of Apple&rsquo;s famous WWDC event. As per usual, Apple opened the event with the only part of the event that isn&rsquo;t under NDA (and hence the only part that I&rsquo;ve actually been able to see so far), the keynote. The keynote was a blast with lots of new, exciting things announced. Here&rsquo;s my thoughts on a couple of those things that were announced. Updated MacBook Airs The updated MacBook Airs are really nice.

      Good news! Just the other day, SymSteam, my small pet project, received a pretty major update. In fact, this update is so major, I&rsquo;ve labelled it Beta 1. Pretty much everything to do with SymSteam has changed. Beta 1 brings numerous new features and changes to the application. A list of the changes is available on SymSteam&rsquo;s new website here but in this post I&rsquo;d just like to elaborate on some of the features and the work that&rsquo;s gone into beta 1 of SymSteam.

      <h2>Feb 18, 2012</h2>
      SymSteam, my small project I released just a few weeks ago, received its first major update today. Version 0.1.5 was pushed to the GitHub repo a few hours ago and with it came an important new feature and some bug fixes. The most important new feature is a new preferences window which allows you to change the where your symbolic and local SteamApps folders are located. This is pretty handy since, previously, the only way to change these paths was to delete SymSteam&rsquo;s plist file.

      <h2>Feb 14, 2012</h2>
      In the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a bit of an epiphany. I&rsquo;ve become incredibly security and privacy conscious. I&rsquo;ve closed my Facebook account, started moving away from Google and begun using far stronger, unique passwords. In the past, for websites, I&rsquo;ve had one strong password which would be impossible to guess and then used that on every website (except my bank, which doesn&rsquo;t allow special characters in a password). I know, shoot me.

      <h2>Feb 5, 2012</h2>
      I&rsquo;ve just released a new project on GitHub. It&rsquo;s called SymSteam and it&rsquo;s for anybody who likes to play Steam games on their MacBook Air (or any other Mac for that matter). MacBook Airs are reasonably powerful machines, not gaming machines but with the Intel HD graphics inside of them they can handle many of the games on OS X without too much difficulty. The problem is, games are big and SSDs are small.
