## What is Geography AS Notes?

Geography AS Notes is a revision website aimed at students in the UK studying Geography at AS Level. In particular, it's aimed at students taking the AQA course and studying the following four topics:

- Rivers, Floods & Management
- Coastal Environments
- Population Change
- Health Issues

I don't cover any extra topics on the AQA specification as I'm not experienced with them and wouldn't be able write about them to a high enough standard.

When the site first launched the content consisted of notes I had made during class. Nowadays the site's content consists of researched, long-form prose. There are still older note style articles on the site but I'm slowly rewriting them as long-form articles.

## Is it Actively Maintained?

Yes. In early 2014 the site received a major redesign that enhanced readability and made using it much more enjoyable. At the same time, many of the diagrams on the site were redrawn as vector graphics to enhance their quality.

I update articles as and when I have time. I prioritise fixing mistakes and adding information that is frequently asked for in emails. At the same time, older articles that are still in note-form are being rewritten as long-form content. This is a slow process though because of the extensive research performed for each article[^1].

## Do You Accept Contributions?

Absolutely. There's a [detailed page][contributing-page] on the website about making contributions but the tl;dr is I'm open to text and image contributions. Text contributions can be as small as corrections or as big as brand new pages (so long as they're related to the AQA specification). Images can be either photographs or diagrams. The only thing that I ask is you check the license of the image first. I don't want any legal trouble.

If you're interested in contributing to the site, please read the [information on Geography AS Notes][contributing-page] about the guidelines before doing anything.

## How Strictly Does it Follow the AQA Geography Specification?

Of the four topics covered by the website, they're around 95% complete according to the specification. At some point I'll add the information to make them 99% complete but there's a lot of things that need to be done before then.

## Is it Open Source?

Yup. As mentioned above, I'm open to text and image contributions. In addition, the source code for the site is available on [GitHub][geographyas-notes-github] for people to learn from and contribute to.
