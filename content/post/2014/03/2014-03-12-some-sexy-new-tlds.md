Today I became the proud owner of [alexj.sexy][alex-sexy] following in the footsteps of people like Myke Hurley of [myke.sexy][myke-sexy]. This is possibly the best $25 I've ever spent.

Joking aside, I couldn't help but notice how stupid some of the new TLDs are. A sliver do allow for some creative and memorable domains but for the most part they're pretty useless. Take, for example, the `.guru` TLD. How many times in the past year have you referred to someone as a guru? I'd guess it's a pretty small number.

I'm probably getting cranky over nothing here. Nowadays people don't access a website via its domain name anyway so the new TLDs will likely be of little importance. Still, I find it funny to think that a board of people at ICANN looked at TLDs like `.sexy` or `.cool` and thought they were good.
