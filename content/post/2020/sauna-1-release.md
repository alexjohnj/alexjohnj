I'm pleased to announce the release of a new macOS app I've been working on for
a few weeks. Called _Sauna_, it's a lightweight app that displays your Steam
friends list and notifies you when a friend comes online. Of course, this is all
functionality that the Steam client provides but the goal of Sauna is to be a
good macOS citizen and to be extremely lightweight.

<!--more-->

Sauna regularly updates your friends list throughout the day and notifies you
when a friend comes online or starts playing a new game. It's focused on doing
just this one thing.

Sauna is useful for those of us who game in Boot Camp or have a dedicated PC for
playing games. With Sauna you can check in on your friends without rebooting
your Mac or booting your PC.

You can download the first release of Sauna from the [project's GitHub
page][sauna-releases]. It requires macOS 10.15 or later. You'll need a Steam API
key to use it which you can get by filling in [this form][steam-api-key-form] on
Steam's website.
